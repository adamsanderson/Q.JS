Q(estion/ueue)

A set of functions for making assertions and queue/list/array processing more straight forward.

It has very high unit test coverage so can confidently be used to reduce the number assertion based tests in other areas.

Methods starting is* return boolean for first argument.

The rest allow creation of functions that iterate over lists (fold and map are probably most usefull).

Q is heavil inspired by Scheme and the exercise in the Little Schemer by Daniel P Freidman and Matthhias Felleisen.

isF(untion)
isO(bject)
isA(rray)
isS(tring)
isN(umber)
isE(mpty)A(rr)
isE(mpty)S(tr)
isEq(al)
isU(ndefined)
areEq(ual)
inA(rray)

List processing, uses iterative or recursive technique (set to iterative by default - although some JS engines are tail recursion optimised and run faster than iteration)

h(head) - returns the head of a list h([1,2,3]);//1
t(ail) - returns the tail of a list Q.t([1,2,3]);//[2,3]
cons(concat in front)

objHas - obj = {a: {b: {c: 1}}} -> objHas(obj, "a.b.c") // true Q.objHas(obj, "a.x.y.z") // false
